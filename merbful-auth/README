You can find the original at http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/restful_authentication/

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions \
		--include-activation
		
The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup
(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is 
created (if migrations are available), as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is
the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the 
site.

The third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a 
Mailer and the required support code.  Don't forget to setup your mailer for this.
